>Self-forgetful writing, mirror stage, authorship -- these are the three technological steps to the poetic career. But in order to record them a medium beyond books is necessary, a medium that was lacking in the writing system of 1800. What the motion-picture camera would debase a century later, to the laughter of both sexes, shone in 1800 as the highest technological achievement in the medium. Central Europe entered -- not in the statistical sense that concerns social historians, but in a programmatic sense that made the future -- the condition of general alphabetization. Writing no longer required the virtues of vigilance and attention, the ascesis of a learned class. It could become a skill of the fingers, which would write on through dreams, drunkness, or darkness. Without disturbance or channel interference, without delay or ttransmission losses, the medium of writing transporeted pure signifieds or--fixed ideas. Alphabetization in the flesh made possible an automatic writing that was not automatic writing. For only from 1896 on, when rereading was prohibited, would unconscious writing yeld pure signifiers. In 1800, however, an act of writing as punctual as it was unambivalent stood between two universal poles that neutralized the act: before it was the signified that had to be translated, behing it was an authorship that could enjoy the work of independent fingers as its own possession.
